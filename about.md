Hi Welcome to my blog! my name is Jessica, but you can call me Jessi. My love for plants started very young thanks to my mom and grandparents. We can say I grew up always having plants inside and outside the house, and since I moved to WSU three years ago my plant collection has grown drastically and not going to stop any time soon!

Since I got the chance to pick an interesting topic for English 402 under Buddy Levy, I decided to research more about trendy and ingenious methods of agriculture that I have zero knowledge of. For this study, I specifically send my focus on hydroponic agriculture given that in recent years it has become a popular way to grow non-indoor plants such herbs and veggies indoors. This blog covers all information I have gathered about the future of hydroponic gardening and the positive aspects of this ingenious method of farming. Hope you enjoy all the information as much as I did in my journey learning about this intriguing topic!
