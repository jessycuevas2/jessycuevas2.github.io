As the population around the world increases, food production must double to meet demand. However, other issues such as climate change, lack of distribution resources, and land degradation are challenging farmers, particularly urban farmers, around the world to meet the population needs by 2050. Many possible solutions have been investigated and some have been applied for quite some time. But one such application that has been popularized, particularly among urban small scale farmers, in recent years is hydroponics.

Hydroponic farming has been around for centuries, but it was until the 1930s and 1940s that one man named Dr. W.F. Gericke brought hydroponics (also known as nutriculture) to the forefront. With the war in the Pacific, Gericke applied hydroponics to commercial production in non arable islands where troops were stationed. And soon after the war, hydroponics was adopted by the greenhouse industry to resolve problems with soil-borne diseases and pests as well as structural and nutritional challenges that came year round around greenhouses. Fast forward to today, almost all crops that grow in greenhouses use some form of hydroponics. And its potential to grow crops in limited urban living spaces can be part of the solution to food production challenges. How cool is that!
