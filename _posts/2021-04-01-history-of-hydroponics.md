title: The History of Hydroponics
---

It is hard to believe that a system, were plants grown without any soil, supported by a soilless substance, fed a water solution rich in nutrients in a carefully crafted futuristic looking structures come from ancient soilless culture from ancient civilizations. 

The first known instance of water-based hydroponics goes way back in the hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the seven Wonders of the Ancient world.  The garden flourished off of an elaborate watering system that supplied a steady stream of river water rich in nutrients. Located of the east Euphrates River near a present day Baghdad, the gardens were build by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II as a gift to his wife, Amytis.

Similarly, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics dating back to several hundred years BC depict the growing of plants along the Nile River without soil. As well as the floating gardens of the Chinese, described by Marco Polo in his famous journals. 

An ingenious method of utilizing the concepts of hydroponics, was developed by the Aztecs of Central America. The Aztecs learned how to build rafts of rushes and reed that they described  as chinampas. Chinampas, or “floating gardens”, were stalk and tough roots that were lashed together and loaded up with sediment from the shallow lake bottom. This sediment provided a rich variety of organic compounds and mineral that the Aztecs used to nourish their crops.

The chinampas supported abundant crops of vegetables, flowers, and even trees. The roots of the plants grew through the floor of the chinampas allowing a constant water source and root oxygenation. Also, they were sometimes joined together to form floating islands as much as two hundred feet long flanked by waterways and drainage canals. Some chinampas even had a hut for a resident gardener. On market days, the gardener might pole his raft close to a marketplace, picking and handing over vegetables or flowers as shoppers purchased them. Talk about local agriculture!

The earliest recorded scientific approach to discover the requirements of plant growth was in 1600 when Belgian Jan Van Helmont showed in his classic experiment that plants gathered substances from water. His experiment consisted of planting 5-pound willo shoot in a tube containing 200 pounds of dreid soil isolated to ensure accuracy. After 5 years of watering with rainwater, he found the willow shoots increased in weight by 160 pounds while the soil lost less than 2 ounces. Hi conclusion was that plants obtain substances from growth from water. However in his experiment, he failed to realize that they also acquire carbon dioxide and oxygen from the air to grow. 

Fast forward to 1792, the English scientist Joseph Priestly discoverer that putting plants in a chamber containing high levels of carbon dioxide, the plant will gradually absorb it and give off oxygen.

A couple of year later, Jean Ingen-Housz carried Priestly’s went a step further and demonstrated that plants set in a chamber filled with carbon dioxide could replace the gas with oxygen within several hours if the chamber was placed in sunlight. Ingen-Housz went on to establish that this process worked more quickly in conditions of bright light, and that only green parts of the plant were involved.

Moving though the middle of the 19th century scientist determined the composition of plants and the substances required of the growth. It was discovered that soil itself was not beneficial to the plant for anything other than support and holding the nutrients and minerals needed for growth. This generalization of the complex dynamic of humus, the nutrient-dense byproduct of the natural decomposition of organic materials into a non-living organic matter, and microbes in healthy soil systems. But, nevertheless. It paved the way to a greater understanding of  what was essential for the growth of plants and hydroponic technology. 

In 1860 Julious von Sachrs, Professor of Botany at the University of Wurzburg, published the first standard formula for a nutrient solution that could be dissolved in water that could successfully improve plant growth. . This new technique was named “nutriculture”. This early experiments in plant nutrition demonstrated that normal plant growth can be achieved by immersing plants’ roots in water solution containing Nitrogen (N) , Phosphorous (P), Sulfur (S), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), and Magnesium (Mg). 

In addition to Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Carbon that are all derived from the air and water. These nine elements are defined as the macronutrients. With further laboratory experimentation scientist established seven additional elements requred for plant growth. These include Iron (Fe), Chlorine (Cl), Manganese (Mn), Boron (B), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), and Molybdenum (Mo). This elements are required by plants in relatively small quantities, thus called micronutrients or trace elements. 

With further research in recent years, the actual numbers of elements plants required for plant growth is a matter of debate, some say 15 is enough while other says 17 may be necessary. Nevertheless, there is no absolute requirement. There is need of further research, however, it is worth noting that hydroponic agriculture typically yields a higher quality corp relative to the budget fertilizers used in conventional agriculture. 

In terms of general use, interest in the application of nutriculture did not develop until 1925 where the greenhouse industry expressed interest in its use. Dr. Victor Tiedjens was a early pioneer of soilless growth in the 1920’s and 1930’s. Generally in the early days if a farmer was using fertilizer they would use a dry form, but in his research Dr. Tiedjens  had found that plants can only absorb fertilizer nutrients in a soluble form. He eventually rationalized that if he dissolved dry fertilizing materials in water, they were better utilized by the plant. This led to the beginning of liquid fertilizers.

In addition to developing soluble fertilizers,  Dr. Tiedjens experimented by bypassing soil and applying liquid fertilizers directly into plants. This became the beginning of foliar nutrition of plants, but not until after he substituted higher grade raw materials for the normal materials found in dry fertilizers.

Meanwhile in 1929, Dr. William F. Gericke of the University of California effectively transformed his nutriculture laboratory into a commercial crop production operation. First calling it “aquaculture”, he learned this term was already being used for aquatic organisms and termed his nutriculture systems “hydroponic”, meaning literally “water” (hydro) and “working” (ponos), or working water, in Greek.
His operation was a tremendous success. Newspapers printed outlandish headlines claiming an agricultural revolution with pictures of Dr. Gericke atop his ladder harvesting his 25 foot tomato plants.

Unfortunately, this much popularity brought unfounded claims that did more harm than good for the acceptance of hydroponics. People feeding off the fervor created by the press profited on selling useless equipment to naive consumers hoping to take advantage of the new invention. This led the science of hydroponics dormant until global endeavors deemed it undeniable. 

The scientific curiosity in hydroponics was revived when the U.S government sponsored experiments when World War II started in 1939. The United States and British Army’s established hydroponic units at military bases on several islands in the Pacific to provide fresh produce to troops during wartime.

After WW II the military continued to use hydroponics as its sole method of overseas food production. The US Army’s hydroponic branch grew over 8,000,000 pounds of fresh produce in 1952, a peak year for military demand. Some of the most successful operations have been those at isolated bases, notably in Guyana, Iwo Jima, and Ascension Island. 
During the middle of the 20th century many setbacks surfaced, including crude environmental controls, poor growing mediums, and the use of unsuitable materials. Concrete used for growing beds became toxic and iron pipes corroded quickly, also releasing harmful or toxic substances into nutrient solutions.
With the adoption of plastics in the 1970’s hydroponics was finally considered a viable way of cultivation. Plastic freed growers from pricey construction and destructive properties of early system components. With the development of suitable pumps, timers, plastics pluming, and effective media,  hydroponics systems could now be automated and streamlined reducing both capital and operational costs. Hydroponic became available for personal and commercial uses in a cost effective manner. 

Today hydroponics has been successfully adopted in the mainstream and even accepted for use in “organic” cultivation by the USDA. The use of a hydroponic cultivation can address current environmental issues of the 21st century, such as food and water scarcity. Hydroponic agriculture can produce ten times the yield per acre and use 1/20th of the water than traditional agricultural methods.
Applying this method commercially further and even locally on our own home can vastly benefit the planet and humankind.
