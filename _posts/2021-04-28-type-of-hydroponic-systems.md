title: Type of Hydroponic Systems
---

Like traditional methods of agriculture, there is different types of hydroponics systems. The two primary types of hydroponics are solution culture and medium culture. In solution culture there is no solid medium for  root support, there is just nutrient solution while the medium culture has a solid medium to support the roots of a plant. The type of medium been used can be sand, gravel, coconut husk, or rockwool. 


<ins>**Solution Culture**<ins>

For solution hydroponic culture there are three main methods of growing plants. The static solution method, continuous flow solution method and the aeroponics method. 

**Static Solution Method**

The static solution method, or also know as water culture is by far the simplest hydroponic system. This is a passive system, were water is not flowing or moving. In this method plants usually are grown in containers of nutrient solution, such as glass mason jars, plastic water bottles, plastic buckets, tubs or tanks. The water solution may or may not be aerated but usually gentle aeration is required. If the solution is unaerated, the level of solution is kept low so that enough roots are above the solution to get adequate oxygen. The platform that holds he plants is usually made of Styrofoam or plastic and float directly on the nutrient solution. Aeration can be provided by an aquarium pump, aquarium tubing and valves. To provide oxygen to roots of the plants. This type of hydroponic system is a great way start an a small hydroponic herb or leafy greens garden. 

**Continuous Flow Solution Culture**

In this system the nutrient solution constantly flows past the roots in continuous flow culture. The advantage of this method is that is easier to automate than a static solution method, since sampling and adjustments to the temperature and nutrient concentrations can be made in a large storage tank that can serve potentially thousands of plants. A popular technique of this method is the N.F.T. (nutrient film technique). Which is a very shallow stream of water contains all the dissolved nutrients, is re-circulated past the base roots of plants in a watertight gully, known as channels. The depth of the recirculating stream remains very shallow, this ensures that the think root mat in the bottom of the channel is in the air and there is an abundant supply of oxygen to the root of the plants.

**Aeroponics**

The aeroponic method is probably the most high-tech type of hydroponic gardening. Like the N.F.T. system above the growing medium is primarily air. The roots hang in the air and are misted with nutrient solution. The misting are usually done every few minutes. Because the roots are exposed to the air like the N.F.T. system, the roots will dry out rapidly if the misting cycles are interrupted.
A timer controls the nutrient pump much like other types of hydroponic systems, except the aeroponic system needs a short cycle timer that runs the pump for a few seconds every couple of minutes.


<ins>**Medium Culture**<ins>

In this method there a two primary variations for each media,, sub-irrigation and top irrigation. For this systems most hydroponics reservoirs are built of plastic but other materials can be used including concrete, glass, metal and wood. The containers   should be such that it excludes light to prevent algae growth in the nutrient solution.


**Passive Sub-irrigation**

This method is also known as passive hydroponics or semi-hydroponics or wick sytem. Plants are grown in an inert porous medium that transports water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action from a separate reservoir when necessary. Reducing labor and providing a constant suppl of water to the roots. It is a very simple method in which a pot is kept in a  shallow  solution  of  fertilizer  and  water or on a capillary mat  saturated with  nutrient solution. The media (expanded clay and coconut  husk)  that  contain more air space than traditional potting mixes deliver increased oxygen to the roots. 


**Top Irrigation**

The system usually uses individual pots for plants. The water from the reservoir is connected to the plants by a network of tubing.
There are two ways to apply pressure to the water supply. It can be a regular water pump or a gravity-based system. Each individual plant gets at least one dedicated drip emitter. Each emitter has mechanisms that allow you to control the flow of water.

Regardless of the system used, the potential for a hydroponic system is possible by using any of this methods. Each plant would benefit to a specific type of method but if done correctly, this hydroponics methods will yield healthy and flavor rich plants.
