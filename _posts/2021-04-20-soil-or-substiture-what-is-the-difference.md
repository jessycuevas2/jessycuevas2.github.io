title: Soil or Substitute, What is the Difference?
---

So you may be wondering what is really hydroponics? So far we know is a way to grow plants, but what does it really consists for a plant to grow in a hydroponic system? 
Well the definition of hydroponics has been broadened over the years to the point that it has almost become a synonymous with soilless culture, which includes plant cultivation in any inactive substance, whether solid or liquid. 

Solid substances such as gravel, sand, vermiculite, perlite and rockwool, and liquid substances such as nutrient rich water solutions. By this broad definition of hydroponics we can say most plants grown in greenhouses, container nurseries and home can be considered to be growing hydroponically since in most cases in this places soil is rarely used. 

The most popular type of hydroponic culture system is the solution method or a combination of both a solid substitute, a solid substance, and a water solution rich in nutrients. Today,  solution culture hydroponics is still an important research technique and is the method NASA scientists use to grow plants in place stations.

Due to the use of nutrient solutions and a complicated looking setup, people assume that hydroponics is all chemistry and the plants grown by this technique is not natural or “inorganic”. However, this is not true. A basic high-school level chemistry understanding or a wiliness to learn can understand how to prepare nutrient formulations and a basic system. 

Plants require the same essential elements regardless of whether they abstained by nutrient solutions or natural breakdown in the soil. What is great about hydroponics is that one can provide plants with optimum levels of each essential elements through a carefully crafted nutrient solution formulation. While when growing in soil, these same nutrients are added through the use of fertilizers and compost, but with a disadvantage in getting those nutrients through the plants due to the soil’s heterogeneity. That’s awesome! But how important, really, is soil in the growth process of a plant? Turns out is not as complicated than expected...

Soil’s part of growth of a plant depends greatly of its specific nature and properties. Different types of soils, such as sand, sandy loam, loam and clay, are determined  by  their  percentages  of  natural  inorganic  particle  sizes  and  organic  matter.  Sandy soil composed of large mineral particles permits water and nutrients to move quickly through it and past the root zone of plants. These are not ideal for vegetable growing  unless  large  amounts  of  water  and  fertilizers  are  supplied  regularly. 

Pure  igneous (volcanic) sand in fact is suitable as a hydroponic medium, where oxygenation to plant roots is readily available. At the other extreme is clayey soil that consists mainly of small particles that hold together tightly retaining water and minerals. This  type  of  soil  often  has  excess  water  with  poor  drainage  causing  lack  of  oxygen  to  plant  roots. With  this  poor  aeration,  plants  also  suffer  from  lack  of  mineral  uptake.

A loamy soil has a good mixture of large and small minerals plus organic matter, which provides adequate minerals, water, and oxygen to the plants. But, maintaining  soils  in this optimum state of  structure and fertility is often challenging, requiring soil tests and frequent additions of fertilizers and compost of adequate quantities for plant growth.

Hence, the need for a specific type of soil will be mostly based on the type of crop or plant. The main goal for the use of soil is to foothold support, distribute nutrients and provide a filtering system for a plant to grow successfully. Therefore there is not a perfect type of “soil” mixture that would work for every plant. Some crops grow better in more porous soil, while other grow well in higher water retention substrates. 

With hydroponics, the choice of substrate depends on the availability, cost, crop, water  retention,  oxygenation,  structural  integrity,  and  sterility. However, oxygenation is important to all plants, no matter the type of system,  so drainage is critical, especially for long-term crops such as tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, cucumbers, and other vine crops. Some short-term crops, such as herbs (basil, mint, and watercress) and lettuce can grow in only water culture systems. But for the majority of crops, the ability for a substrate to retain its own structure and support the growth of a plant is important to hydroponic growing such as soil growing.

Overall, hydroponics and soil systems are not different with regard to the needs of plants. The chemistry behind both systems want the same goal of giving the plants the ideal levels of nutrients. The only difference is the way plants obtain those nutrients, whether by slow-release compounds (soil culture) or by fast-release highly soluble compounds (hydroponics) . All aspects of plant training, pest and disease control, and even watering by a drip irrigation system apply to both systems. However, in the case of hydroponic culture there is the advantage of extend growing season by the control of environmental factors, such as temperature, light, carbon monoxide, and humidity. In addition to fast-uptake on effective nutrient intake that provides optimal results and faster growth.
